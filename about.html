    <p data-ix="section-interaction" class="ab-case">Hello!<br><br>Welcome to my world! This is a self-developed website. All resources, graphics, images, animations and contents used in this site have been created by me.<br><br>I have been serving the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh since January 1991. I joined the Ministry of Information being qualified as a member of the 9th Batch of the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS), Information Cadre. I obtained the mandatory basic training for the civil service officers at Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre, Savar and National Institute for Mass-Communication, Dhaka. I also equipped myself with various training and workshops on photography, videography, printing and pre-press techniques, language skills in a number of renowned institutions of Dhaka. In 1992, I was transferred to the External Publicity Wing of the <a class="dep" href="https://mofa.gov.bd" target="_blank">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and rendered my services there in various capacities for more than 25 years.<br><br>
    During my tenure in the External Publicity Wing since 1992 till 2001, I was intensely involved in planning, visualization and production of numerous publications in print and electronic media for the Government of Bangladesh. Major works included the production of informative booklets, brochures, posters, diaries, calendars, gift items and other materials for Public Diplomacy and projection of government policies and development activities. My productions were intended for distribution among high dignitaries of countries around the globe through Bangladesh diplomatic missions.<br><br>
    Bangladesh: The Mosaic in Green, Bangladesh Handbook, Bangladesh Towards 21st Century, Meet Bangladesh are among those publications which earned wide acclamation at home and abroad.<br><br>
    In September 2003– I was posted to the <a class="dep" href="https://bdhc-kolkata.org" target="_blank">Deputy High Commission</a> for Bangladesh in Kolkata, India as First Secretary and was assigned the responsibilities of the Head of Chancery. During this period, I delivered my responsibilities in administering day to day activities of the Mission including coordination and implementation of various official, social and cultural programmes. My public diplomacy activities included, among others, organizing fairs, festivals, seminars, exhibitions; planning and production of periodicals, publications etc. Apart from these, I was intricately engaged in projecting and showcasing Bangladesh culture and traditions in the north-eastern States of India. Sharat Utsav (Autumn Festival) and Bangladesh Utsav are among the major events organized by the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, inception of which was on my management and execution. I came back from Kolkata to Dhaka in September 2009 and served the Ministry of Foreign Affairs till April 2013.<br><br>
    I worked in two other Bangladesh Embassies too, in <a class="dep" href="https://bangladeshembassybeirut.org/" target="_blank">Beirut</a> and <a class="dep" href="https://bdembtehran.org" target="_blank">Tehran</a>, as Counsellor since May 2013 till November 2017. I had the opportunity to visit many places of these three countries of my posting. By the opportune scope of my travelling to a number of places, particularly in two hugely endowed countries such as India and Iran, I enriched my memories through capturing images of some pictorial beauty and a few rare wonders of the nature.<br><br>
    My interests include Photography, Digital Imagery, Videography and Video Post-Production, Multimedia Authoring, Design, Web Development, Animation etc. I use with ease a number of design, DTP and multimedia tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, After Effects, Premiere, Audition etc. I held a solo photo exhibition in Kolkata, India in June 2009. I have been awarded the best photographer from Bangladesh in the '1st International Color Slide Exhibition 1996' organized by 'AALOK Group of Photographers'. My photographic works have been published in a number of prestigious publications at home and abroad.<br><br>
    I, along with two associates, authored and produced a bilingual interactive multimedia learning tool entitled <a class="dep" href="edutainment.html">‘Aaj Amader Chhuti'</a> (It’s our holiday today) for children in November 2002.<br><br>
    Presently I am working in the <a class="dep" href="https://mos.gov.bd" target="_blank">Ministry of Shipping</a> as a Joint Secretary.<br><br>
